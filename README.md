# auto-transcoder
Automatically transcode files with the nice [video transcoder](https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding) by don melton and [container](https://github.com/ntodd/video_transcoding_docker) by ntodd.

# Using It
Setup is simple, just edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to your directory to watch and autoconvert. Then just use `docker-compose up` to start things up.
