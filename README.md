# auto-transcoder
Automatically transcode files with the nice [video transcoder](https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding) by don melton and [container](https://github.com/ntodd/video_transcoding_docker) by ntodd.

# Using It
setup is simple, just edit the `.sh` script to point to your video directory and then run `auto-transcode.sh` for it to start watching/transcoding things. If you need different file formats, just edit the relevant part of the `find` in the script.
